# DSO Dev2Dev

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Deployment is done by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dso-devs/dso-devs.github.io/actions). All code in the `main` branch is automatically deployed using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dso-devs/dso-devs.github.io/actions).
